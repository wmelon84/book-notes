## 9 Pragmatic Projects
The purpose of a software development method is to help people work together.

### Topic 49 Pragmatic Teams
 - A pragmatic team is small, members rarely change and everyone knows, trusts and depends on each other.
> Tip 84	Maintain Small, Stable Teams
#### No Broken Windows
 - Quality is a team issue.
 - The team must take responsibility for the quality of the product.
#### Boiled Frogs
 - Encourage everyone to actively monitor the environment for changes.
 - Stay awake for anything that wasn’t in the original understanding.
#### Schedule Your Knowledge Portfolio
 - The team works on more than just new features. Some possible examples include:
   - Old Systems Maintenance: there’s likely maintenance work needs to be done.
   - Process Reflection and Refinement: continuous improvement can only happen when you take the time to look around, 
   figure out what’s working and not, and then make changes
   - New tech experiments: put tasks on the schedule to try the new things and analyze results.
   - Learning and skill improvements: many skills are more effective when spread team-wide.
> Tip 85 Schedule It to Make It Happen
#### Communicate Team Presence
 - The team as an entity needs to communicate clearly with the rest of the world.
 - Generate a brand.
 - Come up with a name for each project. :purple_heart:
 - Come up with a name for the team, it gives it an identity.
#### Don’t Repeat Yourselves
 - Good communication is key, and by “good” we mean instant and frictionless.
#### Team Tracer Bullets
 - Develop individual features that go end-to-end through the entire system.
> Tip 86 Organize Fully Functional Teams
#### Automation
 - Automation is an essential component of every project team.
#### Know When to Stop Adding Paint
 - To be completed at reading club.

### Topic 50 Coconuts Don’t Cut It
Do not invest in the superficial artifacts.
#### Context Matters
 - Consider de context of your own company/team before adopting policies or processes.
> Tip 87 Do What Works, Not What’s Fashionable
 - How do you know “what works”? Try it.
#### One Size Fits No One Well
 - Take the best pieces from any particular methodology and adapt them for use.
#### The Real Goal
 - The goal is to deliver working software that gives the users some new capability at a moment’s notice.
> Tip 88 Deliver When Users Need It
 - For continuos delivery you need a solid infrastructure
### Topic 51 Pragmatic Starter Kit
These are the three legs that support every project: Version Control, Regression Testing and Full Automation
#### Drive with Version Control
 - Keep everything needed to build your project under version control.
 - Deployment configuration is under version control as well.
 - At the project level, version control drives the build and release process.
> Tip 89 Use Version Control to Drive Builds, Tests, and Releases
#### Ruthless and Continuous Testing
> Tip 90 Test Early, Test Often, Test Automatically
 - Start testing as soon as you have code.
 - So we write unit tests. A lot of unit tests.
 - Knowing you’ve passed the test gives you a high degree of confidence that a piece of code is "done".
> Tip 91 Coding Ain’t Done ’Til All the Tests Run
 - The automatic build runs all available tests: unit testing; integration testing; validation and verification; 
 and performance testing.
> Tip 92 Use Saboteurs to Test Your Testing
 - What is important is the number of states that your program may have. States are not equivalent to lines of code.
> Tip 93 Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage
#### Tightening the Net
> Tip 94 Find Bugs Once
#### Full Automation
> Tip 95 Don’t Use Manual Procedures

### Topic 52 Delight Your Users
Expectations of business value is what really count. The software is only a means to these ends.
 - Everyone on the team is totally clear about the expectations.
 - Critically analyze the user requirements in light of the expectations.
 - Continue to think about these expectations as you progress through the project.
 - As our knowledge of the domain increases, we’re better able to make suggestions on other things that could be done to
  address the underlying business issues.
> Tip 96 Delight Users, Don’t Just Deliver Code
 - "We solve problems." :purple_heart:

### Topic 53 Pride and Prejudice
> Tip 97 Sign Your Work
 - You should be proud to sign your work.
 - You should treat other people’s code with respect.
 - A foundation of mutual respect among the developers is critical to make this tip work. 
 - While code must be owned, it doesn’t have to be owned by an individual.
