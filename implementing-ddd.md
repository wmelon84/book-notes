## Chapter 2 Domains, Subdomains, and Bounded Contexts
There are three things you are going to have to understand very clearly:
- What your Domain is
- What your Subdomains are
- What your Bounded Contexts are

### Big Picture
A Domain is what an organization does, and the world it does it in.
Each organization has **its own unique realm of know-how** and way of doing things.
That realm of understanding is its **Domain**.

#### Focus on the Core Domain
